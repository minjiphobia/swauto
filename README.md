## script usage
- `connect.sh`: connect your phone to your pc through wifi. you need to connect them using usb before executing the script. Android Debug Brigde is needed. once wireless connection establised, unplug usb before running automation scripts. otherwise adb will raise errors.  

- `swauto.py`: dungeon automation script  

- `dhauto.py`: dimensional hole automation script  

- `toaauto.py`: trial of ascension automation script  

**NOTE**: To make the scripts work, u may need to modify the hardcoded pos in `pos.py` and in worst case crop the images suitable for your phone resolution in `pic` directory
